/**
 * Represents an object that can execute workflows against a different endpoint and/or using different credentials

 * cross-account operations (e.g. when there are no API endpoints available other than the workflow service endpoints).
 *
 * Some caveats: this assumes you're already running the real FluxCapacitor against the remote region in the provided account,
 * which should take care of registering workflows, domains, etc.
