/**
 * Tells Flux which method should be called to generate the partition IDs used for a particular partitioned workflow step.
 * Exactly one method should have this annotation for any class implementing the PartitionedWorkflowStep interface.
 * Parameters to this method have the same annotation requirements as parameters to @StepApply methods.
 *
 * The return type of the method must be either List&lt;String&gt; or PartitionIdGeneratorResult.
 * The partition IDs are taken from the provided response object.
 *
 * A maximum of 1000 partition IDs may be returned. This is due to SWF's hard limit on the number of decisions that
 * can be returned as part of a decision task response.
 *
 * If the annotated method throws an exception, Flux will fail the entire decision task and try again.
